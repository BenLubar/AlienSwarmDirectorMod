	"description"		"Upon making planetfall, Bloodhound was unable to establish a link with ground based guidance and tracking systems necessary to land at the spaceport. The captain has decided to drop the marines off a short distance away so they can make their way on foot and bring the guidance and tracking systems back online. The nearby abandoned communication outpost may hold useful information, or perhaps a functioning datalink to the main base."
