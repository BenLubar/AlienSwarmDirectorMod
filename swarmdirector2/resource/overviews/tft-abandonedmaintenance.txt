	"description"		"Having gained access to the base, it's time to move deeper. The swarm are on Tarnor and in high concentrations. These old maintenance and storage sectors should connect up to the spaceport. Be advised that when newer facilities were constructed, these areas were left abandoned. Systems may not function properly here. Be prepared for malfunctions. It's imperative that the squad makes it to the spaceport to find out why the guidance systems are offline and to search for anyone in need of assistance."
